# NixOS infrastructure

This repo is used by the NixOS infrastucture team to hold, manage and document
the server infrastructure needed to run the project.

This includes things like hydra.nixos.org, the binary cache, CDN, email, etc...

## Team role

The infra team is in service to the rest of the project to keep things up and
running (to the best of our abilities).

If you are a member of the project and need infrastructure, feel free to reach
out by creating a new issue on this repository. Please remember that our
capacity is limited so if you really want to see something happening, the best
way is to ask how you can help, and we'll try to find a way to make you part of
the team.

## How the team functions

Each member is voluntary and taking on part of the infrastructure they want to
work on.

In general we try to reach overall consensus on decisions, and the team lead is
here to listen and make judgement calls when no clear direction is available.

The current team lead is @mweinelt (hexa on Matrix).

Because the team size and budget is limited, we try to only take on new projects
we feel we can manage.

The best way to join the team, is to start helping out. Ask where you can help
and start tackling some tickets. If you're unsure what to work on, you can join
or bi-weekly call (see below).

## Team

There are two teams managing this repository. The responsibility of both teams
is to provide infrastructure for the Nix and NixOS community.

### [@NixOS/infra-build](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/infra-build)

This team has access to all the infrastructure, including the build
infrastructure. The members are a subset of the next team.

### [@NixOS/infra](https://github.com/orgs/NixOS/teams/infra)

First level responders. This team helps with the high-level infrastructure.

All the members should be watching this repository for changes.

## Regular catch up

We meet regularly over Jitsi to hash some issues out. Sometimes it helps to have
dedicated focus and higher communication bandwidth.

There is an open team meeting **every other Thursday at
[18:00 (Europe/Zurich)](https://dateful.com/convert/zurich?t=18)**. See the
[google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=b9o52fobqjak8oq8lfkhg3t0qg@group.calendar.google.com)
(search for "NixOS Infra") to see the next date.
