## [hexa, delroth] EMS Migration

- Configuration hasn’t been written yet, hexa might get it done this week.
- When will we get the data?
  - Graham still holding it until it can get cleaned up (removing private user
    data). Board set a deadline during the last meeting.
  - We could talk to EMS directly, to get the account handed over
  - We want ~10 days to do the migration (so: we want the data before Feb 7th)

## NixOS 23.11 upgrades

- Infra currently runs on NixOS 23.05
- No blockers, need to be updated individually

## Deployment setup

- Blocked on secret management, will likely be sops
- Machines use network configuration provided by NixOps

## Bitwarden

- Reason: Self-hosting, currently Jonas pays for the hosted plan.
- PR pending needs to be moved forward: https://github.com/NixOS/infra/pull/287
- delroth/hexa can hand out backup storage credentials.

## Binary cache

- Cost of S3 exceeds Foundation income…
  - Garbage collection will be started
    - Timeline: Start some time in 2024/02
    - Advanced communication will be sent out
    - Build list of store paths we want to keep and configure gc root for them
      - Plan is to keep all FODs
    - Make store paths that are about to get deleted unavailable prior to
      deletion
- Potentially move parts of the cache to Hetzner
  - delroth has capacity to look into this in 2024/02
  - Needs a service to decide, where (S3 or Hetzner) the request would need to
    go
    - Logic could be installed at fastly, to try hetzner first, fallback to s3
  - Service is in the critical path, currently fastly/s3 solve availability for
    us
