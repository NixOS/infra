# 2025-04-03

Attendees: dgrig/erethon, mic92, vcunat

- erethon: 
    - Tested umbriel email server -> works https://github.com/NixOS/infra/pull/600
    - Security bug tracker: no news, still running and ingesting CVEs.
    - Want to work on deprecating go-neb for matrix-alertmanager tomorrow (4/4) https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/549#issuecomment-2764778573
- mic92: 
    - Our Nixos infra hydra patches needs to be fixed or merged into master: https://github.com/NixOS/hydra/pull/1456
    - staging-hydra: 
        - Works and trial-migration worked.
        - We still need to figure out how to copy old store path from old evaluations to the new cache (worked with shivaraj and m1-s)
            - maybe we can use https://releases.nixos.org/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-17.03pre96825.497e6d2/store-paths.xz instead
        - Glacier can be actually also quite expensive or very slow access
            - small objects need to be excluded through filters
            - migration costs from s3
- vcunat:
    - Hydra: 
        - Runs stable 
        - No big issues, xz compression bottlenecks less worse because of more CPU power
        - Build-ingestions of queue-runner is the new bottleneck (maybe a large latency between s3 and the server)
- Jeremy:
    - Mailserver:
        - Everything prepared and we just need to update DNS and sunset the old service
        - Maybe need another dump of the user
        - Saturday: 16:00 UTC / 18:00 Berlin Time
- Arian:
    - binary cache:
        - looked into moving parts of the binary cache into instant access glacier tier
        - phased approach.  E.g. start with `nars/a*` then `nars/b*` etc ...
        - rule of thumb: access is twice as expensive but storage twice as cheap compared to infrequent access.  but same latency guarantees
        - TODO: Please give Mic92 the s3 cost sheet
        - current storage (not bandwidth cost): 
        - Want to enable object versioning on narinfos
- edef:
    - https://releases.nixos.org/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-17.03pre96825.497e6d2/store-paths.xz
    - narinfos are always in standard tier.  due to small size. (Except for some pathalogically large narinfos) 
    - rules
        - recent retrieval
        - recent upload
        - or in releases.nixos.org
