Attendees: erethon, hexa, Mic92

- hexa:
  - E-Mail dogfooding: No obvious issues with sender accounts

- erethon:
  - Will send 616 emails from ngi@nixos.org today unless we're afraid this will
    break something. Testing I've done with a few personal gmail and other
    provider emails worked fine.
  - About replacing go-neb (https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/549), I've
    opened two PRs upstream:
    - One is a security fix
      https://github.com/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager/pull/48
    - The other extends matrix-alertmanager to allow us to have the messages in
      the same format as we currently do with go-neb
      https://github.com/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager/pull/49
  - Security tracker: I'll spin up a second instance so that automatic
    deployment don't break the production deployment.
    - Valentin (fricklerhandwerk) is figuring out how this will be paid to the
      foundation
    - TODO: Investigate reusing evals from GitHub Actions or Hydra
      - especially what information do you need from the evals

- Mic92
  - Will reach out to Picnoir to test Multi-Signer-Setup on staging hydra
