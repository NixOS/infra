Attendees: hexa, mightyiam, mic92, jfly, picnoir, mightyiam

- hexa:
  - hydra-server abuse management
    - loki for nginx analyzing the access logs
    - internal grafana instance for access to sensitive data (e.g. PII)
    - looking at whether go-away can better reflect our needs
  - hydra-queue-runner work
    - runnables are steps that can be sent to builder to realize
    - we have far more linux capacity than darwin capacity and the queue runner
      often stacks up darwin runnables, but cannot satisfy linux runnables
      - effectively preventing us from increasing linux capacity
    - Every two weeks meeting with Simon
    - hydra is modular, components use the database to synchronize

- jfly
  - can we put our meetings on the nixos cal?

    - TODO: jeremy will add
  - mailserver
    - mxlogin.com (mxroute) Deliverability: unclear what's going on with
      Valentin's email (https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/668)
    - Bounces from GMail: does anyone have any ideas for this?
      https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/650
    - Leaking email: https://github.com/NixOS/infra/issues/649
      - TODO: try BCC-ing the people we're forwarding to (`recipient_bcc_maps`
        instead of virtual alias maps)
    - ARC: are we OK to enable it? https://github.com/NixOS/infra/pull/634
      - Test it on another mailserver first

- Mic92:
  - Get rid of nix/hydra overlay to make sure we are not mixing nix from
    unstable with nixpkgs from stable
  - Would likes to reproduce cgroups build issues in NixOS infra

- picnoir:
  - Cache key rotation https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/pull/149
    - Minimal approach, no HSM etc.
      - Generate new key on hydra machine
      - Sign everything with two keys
      - PR in Nix has been merged, not in a stable release yet, but
        cherry-pickable
      - Rollover is easy for NixOS, but not so for Nix users on other Distros
        - Nix already hardcodes the current signing key for cache.nixos.org
        - We could investigate if we can also ship the new one that way
      - Set up and maintain public information about keys, the period in which
        they were used to sign packages
      - Blocked on social issue, needing to take charge
      - Testing on staging hydra
    - Remote-Signing (PR by Raito exists,
      https://github.com/NixOS/nix/pull/9076) would be nice, not super trivial,
      but also new failure point
      - Can fail in a lot of ways, since the channel between the signing infra
        and the queue-runner/nix is undefined, and e.g. over the network is not
        trivial
  - Next steps:
    - Staging Hydra setup to validate the setup/migration script.
    - Investigate Nix upgrade path.

- mightyiam/jfly:
  - Code: https://github.com/molybdenumsoftware/pr-tracker
  - Demo: https://pr-tracker.snow.jflei.com/
  - Alternatives: Replicate the Github Webhooks via pub/sub for anyone
  - Demonstrate the need for this, then we may consider making it an official
    nixos.org deployment
